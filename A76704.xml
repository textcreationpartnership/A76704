            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough there be ſundry conſiderations inviting me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf unto you, yet none doth more encourage me than the information I have received concerning that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Freedom which dwelleth in you, joyned with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight into thoſe various queſtions that are wont to be agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted amongſt diſſenting Chriſtians; I make no doubt but I have been repreſented to you in very hideous colours, whileſt mine Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries one while attribute unto me ſuch opinions, as never came into my thoughts, and which I utterly abhor; another while deſcribe the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which I own, with ſtrange additions and alterations, purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, to make both me and my Opinions odious: But your Lorſhip is not ignorant that theſe are old ſleights of Satan, imployed by him in all ages, to ſcare men from enquiring into the truth, which he hideth from them under the frightfull Vizards of hereſie and blaſphemy; wherefore in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you, ſo wiſe &amp; intelligent a man, who not only uſe your liberty in examining things commonly received, but dare, after examination, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſome of them, (notwithſtanding their commonneſs) becauſe they were not delivered to the Saints from the beginning; I perſwade my ſelfe that I may uſe freedome without offence, and diſcloſe my judgement, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching points, even of the higheſt importance.</p>
            <p>As to my belief (therefore) concerning Jeſus Chriſt (for in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I am chiefly traduced) I herein proceed as in other matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is, to keep cloſe to the Holy Scripture, without turning either to the right hand or to the left: I find then in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and believe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God, whom he begot by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a pure Virgin: And this is the cauſe which the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> aſſigneth why Jeſus ſhould be called the Son of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 35, 36. as for his being eternally begotten out of the ſubſtance of God: this is neither any where delivered in the Scripture, nor conſiſtent with reaſon, ſo that no man (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he wil be wiſe above what is written, and above what is reaſonable) can accuſe me for not acknowledging ſuch a Myſtery. I believe alſo that God annointed Jeſus with the Holy ſpirit, and with power, and that after he had dyed for the confirmation of the New-Covenant, God raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the Heavens, making him both Lord and Chriſt; <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 33, 35, 36. I likewiſe believe with <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> that he is not only my Lord, but alſo my God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20. 28. and with <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:118806:4"/> That he is God over all, bleſſed for evermore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. I believe further that he is to be honoured as the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 23. But the reaſon why (notwithſtanding all theſe glorious elogies) I believe him not to be the moſt high God; is, Firſt, becauſe it is contradictious to ſay the Son of the moſt high God, is the very moſt high God, for then He will of neceſſity be the Son of himſelf. Secondly, Becauſe Chriſt himſelf ſaith to <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen, Iohn 20. 17. Goe unto my brethren, and ſay unto them, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and unto my God and your God.</hi> Thirdly, Becauſe the Divine Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> doth, in the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> ſpeak thus, chap. 1. 8, 9. <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a Scepter of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Scepter of thy Kingdome; Thou haſt loved righteouſneſs and hated ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qity; therefore God, even thy God, hath annoynted thee with the oyle of gladneſs about thy Fellows.</hi> Doth not this Scripture ſpeak of Chriſt as God, by which means the uſual evaſion of the adverſaries is quite excluded, who, when other places of the Scripture are alledged, either that the Father is greater than the Son, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 28. or that God is the head of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. or that <hi>neither the Angels, not the Son, but the Father,</hi> and he only ſometimes knew the day and hour of JUDGEMENT, <hi>Mark 13. 32. Mat.</hi> 24. 3. or that the SON Himſelf, having delivered up the KINGDOME to God even the Father, ſhall become ſubject to him that ſubdued all things unto him, that God may be all in all; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 25. 24. 28. think they can eaſily put off all theſe paſſages, by telling us (though without warrant of the Scripture) that all theſe things are ſpoken of Chriſt only as man, for the fore-quoted paſſage of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>O God, thy God hath annoynted thee with Oyle of gladneſs above thy fellows,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by plainly giving us to underſtand that it ſpeaketh of Chriſt as God.</p>
            <p>As for the efficacy of the death of Chriſt, I believe with the holy pen-men of the Scripture, that we have remiſſion of ſins by it: Neither doth any Chriſtian attribute greater force and vertue thereunto; onely the way (whereby it procureth remiſſion of ſins unto us) cometh into controverſie. I believe therefore, that the death of Chriſt giveth us a right to remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, either as it was the death of the <hi>Teſtator</hi> of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (for according to the reaſoning of the Divine Author to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> where a Teſtament is, there muſt of neceſſity be alſo the death of the <hi>Testator;</hi> for a Teſtament is firm after men be dead, otherwiſe it is of no force whileſt the Teſtator liveth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 15, 16, 17. and therefore if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins was bequeathed to us in the New Teſtament, we could not claim it unleſs the Teſtator had dyed;) or if (which I take to be the truer notion) as it was the death of the Mediator of the New Covenant, it is, becauſe it did confirm and ratifie the ſame, and the promiſes therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, amongſt which remiſſion of ſins is a principal one. For Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants were anciently wont to be confirmed or dedicated with blood, ſee <hi>Exod:</hi> 24. To this ſenſe Chriſt himſelf alludeth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 28. if the word <hi>Diatheke</hi> be, as is elſe where, (ſee <hi>Heb. 8. 8, 9. Gal.</hi> 3. 15. and Chap. 4 verſ.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118806:4"/> 24.) rendred <hi>Covenant;</hi> for ſo it ought to be, elſe there wil be an <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,</hi> of which you ſhal no where read throughout the whole Volume commonly (but erroniouſly) called the <hi>Old Teſtament.</hi> Now what relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath the blood of a Teſtament or Covenant to ſatisfaction of juſtice? And how dare men to wave that efficacy which the Scripture intimateth to be in Chriſts death to procure remiſſion of ſins, and ſubſtitute another that hath no footing there?</p>
            <p>The laſt thing which I ſhal propoſe to your Lordſhip, is the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſence of God, which I never denied, for I acknowledge him to be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where by his knowledge, power and providence. But becauſe I wil not (contrary to Scripture, Reaſon, and Senſe it ſelf) ſay, that the perſon, ſhape, or glory of God, (the two firſt of which expreſſions are as wel uſed of God in the Scripture, as the laſt, ſee <hi>Heb. 1. 3. Ioh.</hi> 5. 37.) is elſewhere reſident than in the heaven only, therefore mine adverſaries have mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly impoſed upon me, as if I ſhould hold, that God is confined to a certain place, whereas to be confined, is a kind of impriſonment, when a perſon is ſo limited to a certain place, as that he ought not to go out of it. But what impiety would it be to ſay that God is impriſoned, or limited to a certain place, out of which he may not ſtir? Now that the perſon, ſhape or glory of God, is in the higheſt heaven, and not elſe-where reſident, is not only evident from the <hi>Dictate of Nature,</hi> obſerved by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Book, <hi>De Mundo,</hi> who ſaith, That all Nations whatſoever give atteſtation thereunto, in as much as when they pray, they lift up their face and hands towards heaven; but is to be found every where in the holy Scripture. Thus is it ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. God looketh down from heaven, the place of his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8. He hath ſet his glory above the heavens. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viour Chriſt doth almoſt perpetually uſe this deſcription of God, that <hi>He is in heaven.</hi> And leſt any man ſhould doubt whether God's being in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only, as to his perſon and glory, and Chriſt's being at his right hand, is to be plainly and properly underſtood, and not in a figure; the thing hath been brought down to the very ſenſe, for it is Recorded of <hi>Stephen, Act.</hi> 7. 55. that <hi>Being ful of the Holy Spirit, he looked ſtedfaſtly up into Heaven, and ſaw the glory of God, and Ieſus ſtanding at the right hand of God: And he ſaid, Behold, I ſee the heavens opened, and the Son of man ſtanding at the right hand of</hi> God. Why ſhould the heavens here be opened to <hi>Stephen,</hi> if the perſon and glory of God are as much in other places as there? How could it be ſaid of him that he looked up ſtedfaſtly into heaven (an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion elſewhere uſed of the Apoſtles, and taken litterally, ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 10.) and ſaw Jeſus at the right hand of God, if he ſaw it only by faith? (which very evaſion (ſo incident it is to error to enſnare it ſelf) doth ſhew that the thing was indeed ſo, for can a man ſee by faith that which is not ſo?) and there was indeed no ſuch thing, as a right and left hand of God; Now if we ſhall not credit the ſight of <hi>Stephen,</hi> filled with the Holy Spirit, how ſhall we believe what the Apoſtles deliver to us as moſt certain, upon the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118806:5"/> authority of their ſight? See 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3 &amp; <hi>Ioh.</hi> 19. 34, 35.</p>
            <p>Thus, my Lord, you have my perſwaſion concerning theſe ſublime points of Religion, the laſt whereof is of ſo great conſequence that the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance thereof hath proved an in-let to ſundry of thoſe truly blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous aſſertions of the Ranters, which I forbear to name, partly out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation towards them, &amp; partly becauſe I know your Lordſhip is not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of them.</p>
            <p>As for my perſecutors, they are wel known to be of that partie which never wiſhed wel to the preſent Government, as for other reaſons, ſo alſo becauſe it doth in the conſtitution thereof, hold forth liberty to all that profeſs faith in God by Jeſus Chriſt, (and I could wiſh that this glory wherewith it hath hitherto ſhined, were not in any caſe ſomwhat ſtained, but I truſt in God that this ſtain wil ere long be done away, by reſtoring me to my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;) theſe are the men, my Lord, that formerly proſecuted Mr. <hi>Kiff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> (as he himſelf wil tel you) and other godly perſons; wherefore I beſeech your Lordſhip: that if there be any conſolation in Chriſt, any comfort of love, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Communion of the Spirit, any bowels and mercies, you would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to imploy your intereſt, in reſcuing me out of the hands of theſe blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty men, whoſe malice, if it prevail againſt me, wil not ſtop there, but extend it ſelf to all other diſſenters whatſoever, and conſequently even to your Lordſhip it ſelf. In ſo doing, you ſhall exceedingly oblige one, whoſe rejoycing is this, even the teſtimony of his conſcience, that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, not in Carnall wiſedome, but in the Grace of God he hath converſed in the world, and who wil ever remain,</p>
